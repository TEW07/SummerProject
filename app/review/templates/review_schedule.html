        <li><b>Consistency is Key:</b> Aim to log in daily or as often as possible to keep up with your reviews!</li>
        <li><b>Understand the Cycle:</b> Your decks rotate through the 14-day cycle. As cards are correctly reviewed, they move to higher decks with less frequent review intervals.</li>
        <li><b>Manage Your Workload:</b> On some days, you may have multiple decks up for review. The Decks page shows you where each deck is in the cycle, allowing you to prepare for these heavier days.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="mb-5 mt-5"><b>Remember:</b> Keeping up with your reviews is important to ensure the information is retained long-term.</p>
